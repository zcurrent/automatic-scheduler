# Automatic-Scheduler
Automatic Scheduler project

I am creating a automatic scheduler. When this project is finished it will take in the number of shifts and times wanted to be filled with the number of employees per shift. Then you can add the employees and their availabilities for each day. Then after running the function generateSchedule(), it should assign shifts to employees and print out the schedule.
